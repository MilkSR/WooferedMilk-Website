Uh, howdy. This a project Redblast1 is working; its a site programmed in Python, using the Flask micro-framework, and the SQLite3 database.

I'll update this more when I have time, PowderedMilk just wanted me to get the project up here so he can look at it, so yeah. 

Currently: 
-The HTML and CSS from a bootstrap I downloaded and edited works, its called index.html.
-And the database I just got working is called wooferedmilk.db, which used the schema.sql to format it.

To do: 
-Create a second table, and work with the Twitch Authorization in that table to confirm the person.
-Add some check boxes/ text boxes to store data to send to the database via a submit button. 
-Change the Janga2 so it loads the users twitch instead of wooferedmilks when logged in
-Landing page to the site, presumily in the '/' directory.
-Load twitch profile picture onto the site/
-Load a lot of users profile pictures to use in a neat graphic or something.
-Edit WooferedMilks bot code to interact with the new database
-Turn off debug mode when I'm done FrankerZ
-Secure everything I guess; i.e. no sql injections and stuff.
-Pretty site up
-Add about page probably.
-Add my twitter and Milks twitter to the page.
